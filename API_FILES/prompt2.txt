Compose an abstract and non-technical explanation of my Solidity smart contract that elucidates its core purpose and broad functionality, while refraining from mentioning any code segments, specific functions, or their details. 
The aim is to communicate the contract's overarching objectives without engaging in technical specifics or low-level implementation descriptions.
After mentioning the summary, mention the signature of any function mentioned in the code and say "Following are the function signatures found in the code:".


pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Calculator {
   
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }

    
    function main(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return add(a, b);
    }
}
